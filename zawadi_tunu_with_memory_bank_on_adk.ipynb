Built as a demonstration of the Agent Development Kit (ADK) for Gemini and the Vertex AI Memory Bank, this agent's core strength lies in its ability to retain and recall nuanced information over time.\n",

            "    *   **Size:** This is generally the most appropriate wheel size for a 5-year-old. A child between **40-48 inches tall (approx. 102-122 cm)** with an inseam of **18-22 inches (approx. 45-55 cm)** will typically fit a 16-inch bike. The most important thing is that her feet can touch the ground comfortably when seated, or at least the balls of her feet for stability.\n",
            "    *   **Training Wheels:** Many 16-inch bikes come with removable training wheels. This is often the stage where kids transition *off* training wheels, but some might still need them for a short period.\n",
            "    *   **Brakes:** Look for bikes with a **coaster brake** (pedaling backward to stop). Some will also include a **front hand brake**, which is great for teaching them how to use it, but coaster brakes are often easier for younger kids to master initially.\n",
            "    *   **Single Speed:** A single-speed bike is perfect. Gears are unnecessary and would only add complexity at this age.\n",
            "    *   **Durability:** Look for a sturdy, but not overly heavy, frame. Aluminum frames are lighter and easier for kids to maneuver.\n",

Using a balance bike for a few weeks or months can dramatically speed up the transition to a pedal bike without training wheels.\n",

              "   \n",
              "   Here are some age-appropriate options and key things to consider for a 5-year-old:\n",
              "   \n",
              "   1.  **16-Inch Wheel Bikes (Most Common for 5-Year-Olds):**\n",
              "       *   **Size:** This is generally the most appropriate wheel size for a 5-year-old. A child between **40-48 inches tall (approx. 102-122 cm)** with an inseam of **18-22 inches (approx. 45-55 cm)** will typically fit a 16-inch bike. The most important thing is that her feet can touch the ground comfortably when seated, or at least the balls of her feet for stability.\n",
              "       *   **Training Wheels:** Many 16-inch bikes come with removable training wheels. This is often the stage where kids transition *off* training wheels, but some might still need them for a short period.\n",
              "       *   **Brakes:** Look for bikes with a **coaster brake** (pedaling backward to stop). Some will also include a **front hand brake**, which is great for teaching them how to use it, but coaster brakes are often easier for younger kids to master initially.\n",
              "       *   **Single Speed:** A single-speed bike is perfect. Gears are unnecessary and would only add complexity at this age.\n",
              "       *   **Durability:** Look for a sturdy, but not overly heavy, frame. Aluminum frames are lighter and easier for kids to maneuver.\n",
              "       *   **Adjustable Seat:** Ensure the seat height is easily adjustable to grow with her.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   2.  **Balance Bikes (If She Hasn't Used One):**\n",
              "       *   **Alternative/Pre-Training:** If she hasn't used a balance bike before, and isn't quite ready for pedals, a larger balance bike could still be a great option. Some 5-year-olds are still developing the fundamental balancing skills. Using a balance bike for a few weeks or months can dramatically speed up the transition to a pedal bike without training wheels.\n",
              "       *   **Benefits:** They teach balance and steering without the distraction of pedals, making the eventual transition to a pedal bike much smoother (often bypassing training wheels entirely).\n",

              "   **Key Considerations When Buying:**\n",
              "   \n",
              "   *   **Fit is Paramount:** More than the wheel size, ensure the bike fits *her*. Have her sit on it. Can she comfortably touch the ground with her tiptoes or the balls of her feet? Can she reach the handlebars comfortably without stretching too much?\n",
              "   *   **Weight of the Bike:** A heavy bike can be very frustrating and difficult for a child to control and learn on. Try to find one that's relatively light.\n",
              "   *   **Safety Gear:** A **properly fitting helmet** is absolutely non-negotiable. It's the most important accessory and should be part of the gift. You might also consider knee and elbow pads.\n",
              "   *   **Testing it Out:** If possible, let her try sitting on a few bikes in a store. Her excitement and comfort level can tell you a lot!\n",
              "   *   **Personalization:** Does she have a favorite color or character? Many kids' bikes come in fun designs that can make the gift even more special.\n",
              "   \n",
              "   **Brands to Consider (often good quality for kids' bikes):**\n",
              "   \n",
              "   *   **Specialized, Trek, Giant, Prevelo, Woom:** These are generally higher-end kids' bikes, very lightweight and well-designed for learning.\n",
              "   *   **Schwinn, Huffy, RoyalBaby, Dynacraft:** More budget-friendly options, often found at larger retailers. Just be sure to check the weight and build quality.\n",

              "1.  **16-Inch Wheel Bikes (Most Common for 5-Year-Olds):**\n",
              "    *   **Size:** This is generally the most appropriate wheel size for a 5-year-old. A child between **40-48 inches tall (approx. 102-122 cm)** with an inseam of **18-22 inches (approx. 45-55 cm)** will typically fit a 16-inch bike. The most important thing is that her feet can touch the ground comfortably when seated, or at least the balls of her feet for stability.\n",
              "    *   **Training Wheels:** Many 16-inch bikes come with removable training wheels. This is often the stage where kids transition *off* training wheels, but some might still need them for a short period.\n",
              "    *   **Brakes:** Look for bikes with a **coaster brake** (pedaling backward to stop). Some will also include a **front hand brake**, which is great for teaching them how to use it, but coaster brakes are often easier for younger kids to master initially.\n",
              "    *   **Single Speed:** A single-speed bike is perfect. Gears are unnecessary and would only add complexity at this age.\n",
              "    *   **Durability:** Look for a sturdy, but not overly heavy, frame. Aluminum frames are lighter and easier for kids to maneuver.\n",
              "    *   **Adjustable Seat:** Ensure the seat height is easily adjustable to grow with her.\n",
              "\n",
              "2.  **Balance Bikes (If She Hasn't Used One):**\n",
              "    *   **Alternative/Pre-Training:** If she hasn't used a balance bike before, and isn't quite ready for pedals, a larger balance bike could still be a great option. Some 5-year-olds are still developing the fundamental balancing skills. Using a balance bike for a few weeks or months can dramatically speed up the transition to a pedal bike without training wheels.\n",
              "    *   **Benefits:** They teach balance and steering without the distraction of pedals, making the eventual transition to a pedal bike much smoother (often bypassing training wheels entirely).\n",
              "\n",
              "**Key Considerations When Buying:**\n",
              "\n",
              "*   **Fit is Paramount:** More than the wheel size, ensure the bike fits *her*. Have her sit on it. Can she comfortably touch the ground with her tiptoes or the balls of her feet? Can she reach the handlebars comfortably without stretching too much?\n",
              "*   **Weight of the Bike:** A heavy bike can be very frustrating and difficult for a child to control and learn on. Try to find one that's relatively light.\n",
              "*   **Safety Gear:** A **properly fitting helmet** is absolutely non-negotiable. It's the most important accessory and should be part of the gift. You might also consider knee and elbow pads.\n",
              "*   **Testing it Out:** If possible, let her try sitting on a few bikes in a store. Her excitement and comfort level can tell you a lot!\n",
              "*   **Personalization:** Does she have a favorite color or character? Many kids' bikes come in fun designs that can make the gift even more special.\n",
              "\n",
              "**Brands to Consider (often good quality for kids' bikes):**\n",
              "\n",
              "*   **Specialized, Trek, Giant, Prevelo, Woom:** These are generally higher-end kids' bikes, very lightweight and well-designed for learning.\n",
              "*   **Schwinn, Huffy, RoyalBaby, Dynacraft:** More budget-friendly options, often found at larger retailers. Just be sure to check the weight and build quality.\n",

Here are some recommendations for a three-year-old:\\n\\n1.  **Creative Play:**\\n    *   **Art Supplies:** Large crayons, washable finger paints, chunky paintbrushes, or a simple easel with paper.\\n    *   **Play-Doh Sets:** These are always a hit and encourage fine motor skills and imaginative creation.\\n    *   **Sticker Books:** Reusable sticker books or large activity sticker books can provide hours of fun.\\n\\n2.  **Building & Construction:**\\n    *   **DUPLO or Large Building Blocks:** Perfect for little hands to build towers, houses, and anything they can imagine.\\n    *   **Magnetic Tiles:** These are fantastic for open-ended building and exploring shapes.\\n\\n3.  **Imaginative & Pretend Play:**\\n    *   **Dress-Up Clothes:** A simple costume (like a fairy, princess, doctor, or animal) can spark endless stories.\\n    *   **Play Kitchen Accessories:** If she has a play kitchen, new food items, pots, or pans can refresh her play.\\n    *   **Doll or Stuffed Animal Set:** A new baby doll with accessories (bottle, blanket) or a set of small animal figures.\\n    *   **Puppets:** Hand puppets can encourage storytelling and communication.\\n\\n4.  **Books & Puzzles:**\\n    *   **Picture Books:** Look for engaging stories with colorful illustrations. Interactive books (lift-the-flap, touch-and-feel) are also popular.\\n    *   **Chunky Wooden Puzzles:** Simple 4-6 piece puzzles with knobs are great for developing problem-solving skills.\\n\\n5.  **Musical Instruments:**\\n    *   **Child-friendly instruments:** A toy keyboard, tambourine, or shakers can introduce her to music.\\n\\nThink about what she's currently interested in, whether it's animals, vehicles, princesses, or creating things, and that might help narrow down the perfect gift!\"}],\"role\":\"model\"}\n",

            "1.  **Soft-Bodied Baby Dolls:**\n",
            "    *   **Why they're good:** These are often the first choice for this age. They are soft and cuddly, perfect for hugging and comforting. Many come with simple outfits that are easy for little hands to put on and take off (great for developing fine motor skills). They encourage nurturing play, like feeding, rocking, and putting to bed.\n",
            "    *   **Look for:** Dolls with soft, washable bodies and simple, chunky clothing. Brands like Cabbage Patch Kids (the soft-bodied versions), Melissa & Doug, or smaller baby doll lines are popular.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Toddler Dolls (like some \"My First\" dolls):**\n",
            "    *   **Why they're good:** These are often slightly larger than baby dolls but still manageable. They might have a bit more articulation (moveable arms/legs) and a wider range of clothing options. They can be good for slightly more complex pretend play scenarios.\n",
            "    *   **Look for:** Dolls that are still relatively soft, or made from durable, child-friendly plastic. Avoid dolls with tiny accessories or intricate hair that will tangle easily. \"My First Princess\" dolls from brands like Disney often fit this category, as they usually have simpler outfits and fewer small parts than the collector versions.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Doll with Easy-to-Manage Hair:**\n",
            "    *   **Why they're good:** At three, many children enjoy brushing and styling a doll's hair. Look for dolls with rooted hair that isn't too long or fine, making it less prone to tangling and easier for little fingers to brush.\n",
            "    *   **Look for:** Hair that feels thick and securely rooted. Some dolls come with a simple brush.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Simple Rag Dolls:**\n",
            "    *   **Why they're good:** These are classic, timeless, and incredibly cuddly. They are usually very durable, machine washable, and have soft, friendly faces. They are great for quiet play and bedtime snuggles.\n",
            "    *   **Look for:** Well-made rag dolls with embroidered features (no small buttons for eyes, etc.) and sturdy stitching.\n",

            "*   **Complex Electronics:** While some dolls talk or sing, too many complex features can sometimes limit imaginative play. A simple doll leaves more room for her to create her own stories.\n",
            "*   **Hair Quality:** Avoid dolls with very thin, wispy hair that knots and frizzes instantly, as it can be frustrating for a three-year-old.\n",

Here are some recommendations for a three-year-old:\\n\\n1.  **Creative Play:**\\n    *   **Art Supplies:** Large crayons, washable finger paints, chunky paintbrushes, or a simple easel with paper.\\n    *   **Play-Doh Sets:** These are always a hit and encourage fine motor skills and imaginative creation.\\n    *   **Sticker Books:** Reusable sticker books or large activity sticker books can provide hours of fun.\\n\\n2.  **Building & Construction:**\\n    *   **DUPLO or Large Building Blocks:** Perfect for little hands to build towers, houses, and anything they can imagine.\\n    *   **Magnetic Tiles:** These are fantastic for open-ended building and exploring shapes.\\n\\n3.  **Imaginative & Pretend Play:**\\n    *   **Dress-Up Clothes:** A simple costume (like a fairy, princess, doctor, or animal) can spark endless stories.\\n    *   **Play Kitchen Accessories:** If she has a play kitchen, new food items, pots, or pans can refresh her play.\\n    *   **Doll or Stuffed Animal Set:** A new baby doll with accessories (bottle, blanket) or a set of small animal figures.\\n    *   **Puppets:** Hand puppets can encourage storytelling and communication.\\n\\n4.  **Books & Puzzles:**\\n    *   **Picture Books:** Look for engaging stories with colorful illustrations. Interactive books (lift-the-flap, touch-and-feel) are also popular.\\n    *   **Chunky Wooden Puzzles:** Simple 4-6 piece puzzles with knobs are great for developing problem-solving skills.\\n\\n5.  **Musical Instruments:**\\n    *   **Child-friendly instruments:** A toy keyboard, tambourine, or shakers can introduce her to music.\\n\\nThink about what she's currently interested in, whether it's animals, vehicles, princesses, or creating things, and that might help narrow down the perfect gift!\"}],\"role\":\"model\"}\n",

            "{\"parts\":[{\"text\":\"That's a lovely idea! Dolls are wonderful for encouraging imaginative play, nurturing, and developing social-emotional skills in three-year-olds.\\n\\nFor a three-year-old, you'll want something that is durable, easy for them to manage, and safe. Here are some types of dolls that are generally great for her age:\\n\\n1.  **Soft-Bodied Baby Dolls:**\\n    *   **Why they're good:** These are often the first choice for this age. They are soft and cuddly, perfect for hugging and comforting. Many come with simple outfits that are easy for little hands to put on and take off (great for developing fine motor skills). They encourage nurturing play, like feeding, rocking, and putting to bed.\\n    *   **Look for:** Dolls with soft, washable bodies and simple, chunky clothing. Brands like Cabbage Patch Kids (the soft-bodied versions), Melissa & Doug, or smaller baby doll lines are popular.\\n\\n2.  **Toddler Dolls (like some \\\"My First\\\" dolls):**\\n    *   **Why they're good:** These are often slightly larger than baby dolls but still manageable. They might have a bit more articulation (moveable arms/legs) and a wider range of clothing options. They can be good for slightly more complex pretend play scenarios.\\n    *   **Look for:** Dolls that are still relatively soft, or made from durable, child-friendly plastic. Avoid dolls with tiny accessories or intricate hair that will tangle easily. \\\"My First Princess\\\" dolls from brands like Disney often fit this category, as they usually have simpler outfits and fewer small parts than the collector versions.\\n\\n3.  **Doll with Easy-to-Manage Hair:**\\n    *   **Why they're good:** At three, many children enjoy brushing and styling a doll's hair. Look for dolls with rooted hair that isn't too long or fine, making it less prone to tangling and easier for little fingers to brush.\\n    *   **Look for:** Hair that feels thick and securely rooted. Some dolls come with a simple brush.\\n\\n4.  **Simple Rag Dolls:**\\n    *   **Why they're good:** These are classic, timeless, and incredibly cuddly. They are usually very durable, machine washable, and have soft, friendly faces. They are great for quiet play and bedtime snuggles.\\n    *   **Look for:** Well-made rag dolls with embroidered features (no small buttons for eyes, etc.) and sturdy stitching.\\n\\n**Things to consider and avoid:**\\n\\n*   **Size:** Make sure the doll isn't too big or heavy for her to carry comfortably.\\n*   **Small Parts:** Absolutely avoid dolls with tiny shoes, hair accessories, or other small detachable parts that could be a choking hazard. Check age recommendations carefully.\\n*   **Complex Electronics:** While some dolls talk or sing, too many complex features can sometimes limit imaginative play. A simple doll leaves more room for her to create her own stories.\\n*   **Hair Quality:** Avoid dolls with very thin, wispy hair that knots and frizzes instantly, as it can be frustrating for a three-year-old.\\n\\nMany brands like **Corolle, Melissa & Doug, Manhattan Toy Company, HABA,** or even generic **soft baby dolls** you might find at toy stores, offer excellent options for this age group. If you can, opt for a doll with a friendly, welcoming expression.\\n\\nHappy shopping! She'll love whatever you choose.\"}],\"role\":\"model\"}\n",

        "* **Explicit remember / forget instructions (`EXPLICIT_INSTRUCTIONS`)**: Information that the user explicitly asks the agent to remember or forget. For example, if the user says \"Remember that I primarily use Python,\" Memory Bank generates a memory such as \"I primarily use Python.\"\n",
